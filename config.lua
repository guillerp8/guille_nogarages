Config.savetime = 5 -- In seconds (IMPORTANT)
Config.moneytoretrieve = 500 -- Money to get back the vehicle.
Config.timetospawn = 40 -- 40 In seconds (IMPORTANT) (I RECOMMEND NOT TOUCHING THIS VALUE) When the first player is loaded the vehicles will load. It requieres a time to 20 seconds to load correctly the player and start the spawn.
